	//why spring put every bean into ioc contanier
// to manage lifecycle
	//we can reuse the ref object 
	
	
	//Dpedency injection - we are using already created bean for each class by injecting it in the dependent class
	//so that same object will be referenced every where 
	
	//By DEFAULT THE  bean scope will be singleton - only one object can be created
	//prototype - we can have multiple objects can be created
